## Overview

This is a React application that lets you track users. The application allows you to view an existing user's name as well as age and register a new user to the list of existing users.

Note that providing the name and age of a user is mandatory before adding a user to the list of existing users (white spaces are not allowed). If you try provide either of them as empty values, you will see a modal opening up and displaying the error message to not keep name and age blank. If you try to add a user with age less than 1 year, the modal will open displaying an error message to not keep age less than 0.

The application is responsive to devices of all screen sizes.
